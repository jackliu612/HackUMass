## Holidays, but with deception

Christmas converter is a website to add some Christmas Cheer to all your photos. During the difficult times of COVID, friends and family are unable to join together and celebrate the holidays. One way to deal with this problem, is to fake some Christman photos. Provide an image to the website from your computer (Hit the "Browse" button) and choose the cosmetics you would like to add to your photos. After that, click "Click me" and the website will return the same photo, but with a bit of the Christmas spirit! Santa's hat and beard and elf hats can be added to your photos. Even if you can't celebrate Christmas together, you can certain pretend you did!
